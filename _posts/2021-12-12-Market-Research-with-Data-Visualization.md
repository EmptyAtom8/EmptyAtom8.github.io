## Project Overview.

A shoe retailing company contacted me, a marketing undergraduate student, to take a look at their yearly sales data. The company wanted to find out which brand is doing the best and bringing the most profit. They had set up some sales targets, but they didnâ€™t know why some of them were not met. I was tasked to reorganise the raw sales data into meaningful information and provide visualisation and insight into specific brand performance. More specifically, I was tasked to set up different KPIs based on regional, seasonal, brand and, customer demographic sales data.
